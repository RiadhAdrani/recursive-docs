### Requirement

<br>

Before starting, we recommend that you learn, at least, the basics of `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavScript`, especially the later, because you can write everything from buisness code to style sheets with it. It is recommended that you get started with the native technologies of your specific platform before using any other framework. For example, You can't use `React` without having a good knowledge of `JavaScript`, well obviously you can, but your experience will be much harder.

<br>

Like every other web framework, `Recursive Web` uses `Node.js` so you can easily install and use your favorite libraries with `NPM (Node Package Manager)`. A bonus point if you are already familiar with it.

<br>

#### What you need to know :

<br>

-   [x] HTML
-   [x] CSS
