### Project Setup

<br>

First of all, make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">`Node.js`</a> installed on your machine, we need it to run the template generator.

Then, you should open a `terminal` within your projects directory, and run this line:

> **âš  WARNING**  
> This command is only supported for `Windows`, we will be working on a fix for `Mac` and `Linux` very soon.

```shell
npx @riadh-adrani/create-recursive-app my-app
```

<br>

Trust the process and enter `y` whenever it is needed.

Your terminal should look something like this :

<br>

```shell
C:\Riadh\Dev\Web>npx @riadh-adrani/create-recursive-app my-app
